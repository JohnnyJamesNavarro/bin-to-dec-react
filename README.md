## Binary-to-Decimal React App

### Description
My take on the [Bin2Dec](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Bin2Dec-App.md) project from the [app-ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas) repository!

### How does it work?
Write a number in binary within the input that appears on screen and you'll get the corresponding decimal version instantly thanks to the magic of React!

Don't worry about incorrect inputs, you can only write 1's or 0's, the app is programmed to ignore any other character thanks to a RegExp ðŸ˜‰.

### Dev Tools
- React.js (`create-react-app`).
  - Functional components with hooks.
